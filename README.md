### NodeJs backedn internship Roadmap :fire:

This is the learning road map for yebox backend developer internship for Javascript and Nodejs.
This road map starts with the basics of programming to advanced concepts in nodejs.

More resources will be provided here as time continues help with the learning process.

### Stage 1: Basics of JavaScript

1. **Core Concepts**

   - Variables and Data Types
   - Operators
   - Control Structures (if-else, switch)
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions)
   - Scope and Closures
   - Arrays and Objects
   - Error Handling (try-catch)

2. **Advanced Concepts**
   - Asynchronous Programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
   - ES6+ Features (let/const, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, classes)

### Stage 2: Introduction to Node.js

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
   - Understanding the Node.js runtime

2. **Node.js Basics**

   - Node.js modules (CommonJS, ES6 modules)
   - The `require` function
   - Creating and using custom modules
   - Understanding the Event Loop

3. **Core Modules**
   - `fs` (File System)
   - `http` (HTTP server)
   - `path`
   - `events`
   - `util`
   - `os`

### Stage 3: Building Simple Applications

1. **Basic Server**

   - Create a simple HTTP server
   - Understanding request and response objects
   - Routing basics

2. **File System Operations**

   - Reading and writing files
   - Working with directories
   - Handling file paths

3. **Asynchronous Programming in Node.js**
   - Callbacks
   - Promises
   - Async/Await

### Stage 4: Web Development with Node.js

1. **Express.js Framework**

   - Introduction to Express.js
   - Setting up an Express server
   - Middleware (built-in, third-party, custom)
   - Routing in Express
   - Handling requests and responses
   - Serving static files

2. **Templating Engines**

   - Using Pug, EJS, or Handlebars to render dynamic content (This is optional as most applications are built as APIs but learning it won't hurt)

3. **Working with Databases**
   - Introduction to databases (SQL and NoSQL)
     - We expect you to have good understanding of databases. Don't be in a hurry to connect. You'll do yourself great good by understanding DB types, structures, engines, datatypes and relationships]
   - Connecting to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - CRUD operations
   - Using an ORM/ODM (Sequelize, Mongoose)
     - if you choose to use anyone it is also fine as this are just examples of common ones.

### Stage 5: Advanced Topics

1. **Authentication and Authorization**

   - Implementing user authentication (passport.js, JWT)
   - Handling sessions and cookies
   - Role-based access control

2. **API Development**

   - RESTful APIs
   - Versioning and best practices
   - Testing APIs (Postman, automated tests)
   - Open API

3. **Error Handling and Logging**

   - Centralized error handling
   - Logging frameworks (Winston, Morgan)

4. **Security Best Practices**
   - Securing Express apps
   - Protecting against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Rate limiting, input validation, and sanitization

### Stage 6: Deployment and DevOps

1. **Environment Management**

   - Managing environment variables
   - Configuration management

2. **Containerization**

   - Introduction to Docker
   - Creating Docker images and containers
   - Docker Compose for multi-container applications

3. **Deployment**

   - Deploying to cloud services (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean)
   - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

4. **Performance Tuning and Scalability**
   - Load balancing
   - Clustering
   - Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
   - Profiling and monitoring (New Relic, PM2)

### Stage 7: Testing and Best Practices

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**

   - Writing tests using Mocha, Chai, Jest
   - Mocking and stubbing
   - Code coverage tools (nyc)

2. **Code Quality**
   - Linting (ESLint)
   - Code formatting (Prettier)
   - Static analysis tools (SonarQube)

### Stage 8: Continuous Learning

1. **Keeping Up-to-Date**

   - Follow Node.js and JavaScript communities (blogs, forums, Twitter)
   - Participate in open-source projects
   - Attend conferences and meetups

2. **Exploring Related Technologies**
   - Frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
   - Other backend technologies (Deno, Python, Ruby)
   - Microservices architecture

### Resources

1. **Official Documentation**

   - [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
   - [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)

2. **Books**

   - "Node.js Design Patterns" by Mario Casciaro and Luciano Mammino
   - "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke

3. **Online Courses**

   - Node.js courses on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and Pluralsight

4. **Practice Platforms**
